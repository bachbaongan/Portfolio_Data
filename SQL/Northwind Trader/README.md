# Project: Northwind Traders Analysis Using SQL and Tableau

In this project, I will analyze Northwind Traders, an international gourmet food distributor, to find insights and help the management team make strategic decisions in several aspects of the business. The projects focus on:

  * Evaluating employee performance to boost productivity,
  * Understanding product sales and category performance to optimize inventory and marketing strategies,
  * Analyzing sales growth to identify trends, monitor company progress, and make more accurate forecasts,
  * Evaluating customer purchase behaviour to target high-value customers with promotional incentives.
