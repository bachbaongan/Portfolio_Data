# Project: Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL

In this project, I will be conducting data analysis on a scale model car database to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) in order to make smarter decisions,
by answering **THREE questions**:

  * Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
  * Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviours?
  * Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

Within the class model care database, we will be working with 8 tables.
